## Lab 1: Straight-line Program Interpreter 直线式程序解释器

### Description
Implement a simple program analyzer and interpreter for the straight-line programming language. This exercise serves as an introduction to environments (symbol tables mapping variable-names to information about the variables); to abstract syntax (data structures representing the phrase structure of programs); to recursion over tree data structures, useful in many parts of a compiler; and to a functional style of programming without assignment statements.
It also serves as a “warm-up” exercise in C programming. Programmers experienced in other languages but new to C should be able to do this exercise, but will need supplementary material (such as textbooks) on C.

### Grade Test
The lab environment contains a grading script named as **gradeMe.sh**, you can use it to evaluate your code, and that's how we grade your code, too. If you pass all the tests, the script will print a successful hint, otherwise, it will output some error messages. You can execute the script with the following commands.
```
shell% ./gradeMe.sh
shell% ...
shell% [^_^]: Pass #If you pass all the tests, you will see these messages.
shell% SCORE: 100
```
